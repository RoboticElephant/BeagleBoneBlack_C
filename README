BeagleBoneBlack_C
=================

C Library for interfacing with the BeagleBone Black. 


*****************************************************
There are 3 Reference Programs:
1) ReadingADC
	Reads the input from an ADC and saves the ADC value along
	with the date/time the value was read and stores it to a
	specific location on the BeagleBone Black, which can be
	set by changing the REQFILE. It reads a value every ten
	minutes and runs for a total of 24hrs.
2) TestOpenCloseADC
	This program enables the ADC cape and then disables it.
	This program was created just to prove an idea
3) TestPWM
	Outputs the PWM on a pin starting from a duty cylce of 0%
	and going to 100%

To run any of the above programs cd into the folder and run "make"

****************************************************

If using the library please add the Hdr.h header file to your main
or whatever file will call the rest of the library. Also add the
specific header of the function you are looking for.

****************************************************

TODO:

1) Currently working on JB_Communication.h to add I2C, SPI, etc.

Known Issues:

1) The bone_capemgr.* always calls out "9" this can be changed in
	the Hdr.h file if you are not using "9"
